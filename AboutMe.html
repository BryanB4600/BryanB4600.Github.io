									<h3 class="major">My story as a developer!</h3>
									<p>Professionally, I'm a self taught programmer with just over a year and a half of experience now, but I've known for most of my life that programming and designing was what I wanted to do. I spent nine months learning HTML, CSS, JS and React before I started the application process.</p>

									<h4>My first professional job was at Fusion Technology Group where I was a Junior Software Developer. </h4>
									<p>Here I gained my first real world experience of project planning and development cycles. I learned how to work in a team setting, communicate work expectations and required resources during weekly team meetings. I broadened my knowledge of front end languages learning how to build mobile friendly, responsive designs. I also got my first interactions with back end languages, learning how to build and communicate with stored data. I also learned how to use data to set state and influence the front end of applications.</p>

									<h4>From here I moved on to Revize Software Solutions where I was a Junior Web Developer as well as handling Tech Support.</h4>
									<p>Here I got my first experience interacting with clients directly on a daily schedule. I learned a lot about the potential day to day demands that clients have and how to solve them in a timely and detail orientated manner. I grew into the role as I learned how to work independently from direct supervision while still maintaining open communication with my supervisors. I also learned how to work within A CMS as an administrator, adding other users, permissions, and plugins to sites. As well, I also learned about making edits to live sites, at times updating whole sections of websites while making sure the code was well maintained and organized.</p>

									<h3 class="major">My life outside of Code</h3>
									<p>Outside of coding my other interests are: video games, music, and traveling. Video games; are a big part of the reason that I'm on this path and I hope to one day be able to code and release a few games of my own. Outside of being a driving innovator for technology, the art form and storytelling that goes along with making a great game is something that I cannot fully express the meaning of in words. Another one of my major passions in life has always been music. I have ventured to a lot of concerts, I've purchased a fair share of CD's and Vinyls. I'm constantly on the search for great new artists to discover. Old or new, and while I have always been drawn to Rock N' Roll, I love all music, from Johnny Cash to Eminem I can name an artist from just about any genre that I want to, or have seen in concert.</p>

									<p>Finally, travelling.. while it is sometimes challenging to find the time or finances to do as much of this as I would like, only a few other things bring me as much joy as exploring a new place or searching back through places I've already been in order to find another new adventure, I love traveling, I've been all around my home state of Michigan, I've been to other cities like Cleveland, Indianapolis, and New York City. I've also been to more rural yet beautiful locations like the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee where my family often vacations. As well as trips to Florida to be a simple tourist and soak up the sun. I hope to be able to do even more traveling and exploring in the future, I would love to see the West Coast and travel the world a bit, I love Japanese culture and would love to see a few European countries as well!</p>

									<p>I hope that this provides a better idea of who I am and some of my interests as well as my driving factors. I've always been passionate and eager to learn. I'm excited about the possibility of working with you on some great projects and look forward to hearing from you soon. My contact info is available below as well as on the homepage of this website. Until then!</p>
