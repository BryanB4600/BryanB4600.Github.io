									<h3 class="major">My story as a developer!</h3>
									<p>Professionally, I'm a self taught coder with just over a year of experience now, but I've known for most of my life that coding and designing was what I wanted to do. I finally came around full circle and really buckled down to test my discipline by embarking on this Odyessy. Driven by a deep curiosity and passion for learing I pushed through the struggles and frustrations that comes along with this beautiful monster. At first I seemingly stumbled in the dark unsure of where to aim. Over time I answered some important questions: what languages did I want to learn? A) I am drawn to both the frontend and backend, I have always been artistically drawn to things like the layout and patterns of webpages that are managed through CSS and proper HTML with the ability to bring it all together with Javascript. While the backend holds so much of the power; I love the data management and storage that is possible in SQL and with JSON. I love the power and creativity of Python, the reality that people are making whole games out of it really drives me to want to learn the language. </p>

									<p>Another question that I answered was: What drives me to want to do this? I've always been a tinkerer, it goes back to fixing my old game systems and laptops, (the Red Ring of Death and a 16 year old's lack of desire to temporarily lose access to his Xbox 360 for a few weeks can really drive determination and ingenuity that was backed by the Youtube search bar(wow life really comes full circle, doesn't it!)) All of this coupled with a desire to be challenged, not just a 'big test in a classroom' challenge, but one of self determination and disciple to sit down as much as often for as long as often and to learn something that would benefit me and challenge me.</p>

									<h3 class="major">My life outside of Code</h3>
									<p>Outside of coding my other interests are: video games, music, and traveling. Video games; as alluded to are a big part of the reason that I'm on this path and I hope to one day be able to code and release a few games of my own. Outside of being a driving innovator for technology, the artform and storytelling that goes along with making a great game is something that I cannot fully express the meaning of in words. Another one of my major passions in life has always been music. I have ventured to a lot of concerts, I've purchased a fair share of CD's and Vinyls. I'm constantly on the search for great new artists to discover. Old or new, and while I have always been drawn to Rock N' Roll, I love all music, from Johnny Cash to Eminem I can name an artist from just about any genre that I want to, or have seen in concert.</p>

									<p>Finally, travelling.. while it is sometimes challenging to find the time or finances to do as much of this as I would like, only a few other things bring me as much joy as exploring a new place or searching back through places I've already been in order to find another new adventure, I love traveling, I've been all around my home state of Michigan, I've been to other cities like Cleveland, Indianapolis, and New York City. I've also been to more rural yet beautiful locations like the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee where my family often vacations. As well as trips to Florida to be a simple tourist and soak up the sun. I hope to be able to do even more traveling and exploring in the future, I would love to see the West Coast and travel the world a bit, I love Japanese culture and would love to see a few European countries as well!</p>

									<p>I hope that this provides a better idea of who I am and some of my interests as well as my driving factors. I've always been passionate and eager to learn. I'm excited about the possibility of working with you on some great projects and look forward to hearing from you soon. My contact info is available below as well as on the homepage of this website. Until then!</p>
